we will be starting off with creating the front end.

npx create-react-app frontend and cd into frontend.

next we will install recharts

npm install recharts, and run npm start.

next we will go to App.js and remove the boilerplate code, and import recharts.

next we will go to recharts.org, and see the documentation. we can grab the example from the right.

after importing and sample data, you should see everything render.

next we will grab a bar chart, to see how that works.

all should be working, we will now create the backend api.
